# About me
I'm Raphael Rodrigues and I've 18 years, I finish highschool in past year and it was a technical school integrated with highschool
## About my academic background
*I made a TI course in ETEC in Lorena-SP* and I learned basics concepts of algorithm and programming. The most of things that I've learned were front-end technologies, **(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Framework Angular for mobile applications)**, but I've learned a little about back-end but in *TypeScript, PHP*, and databases with *PHP and MySQL*
### Projects I liked most that were done at School
I started to like programming 'cause the websites projects I could make funny things and show to my friends just have fun with my free time, the projects with databases for me was so boring and I didn't understand much about that subject, but the mobile applications with Angular that we write the code with TypeScript, I remmeber that subject was hard, but in the end of day I liked and I had a feeling that was messing something. And then we made basic game project with Scratch, I simply found my passion and start my studies of Game Dev
